# Climate Analysis and Climate App ðŸŒŠ

This repository contains a project that focuses on climate analysis and the development of a climate application using Flask. The goal is to perform a basic climate analysis and explore climate data for the city of Honolulu, Hawaii. Dive into the documentation and code files to unlock the secrets of Honolulu's weather patterns. Aloha! ðŸŒ´ðŸŒžðŸŒº


## Project Overview


Welcome to the "Hawaii Climate Explorer" project! Let's analyze the climate before your trip to Honolulu, ensuring you're prepared for paradise.

### Part 1: Climate Analysis & Data Exploration

Using Python, SQLAlchemy, and visualizations, we'll explore the climate database. Highlights include:

- Precipitation: Plotting rainfall trends over the past 12 months.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The most recent observed year's precipitation lacks discernible patterns.*

- Super Station: Identifying the most active weather station and its temperature extremes.
- Temperature Time Machine: Visualizing the temperature observations at the most active station over the last 12 months.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The temperature predominantly hovers around 75 degrees throughout the year.*

### Part 2: Flask Climate App

We're building a fun climate app using Flask. It offers:

- Homepage: Start your journey here.
- Routes: Discover available routes in our app.
- Precipitation Analysis: Retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.
- Station List: Explore the list of weather stations.
- Temperature Observations: Access the previous year's temperature records.
- Custom Date Range: Get minimum, maximum, and average temperatures for specific date ranges.

This repository is organized as follows:

- `SurfsUp`: This directory contains the code files and the resource databases.
- `climate.ipynb`: This file contains ipython code for analyzing data and plots.
- `app.py`: This file contains a climate app written using Flask.
- `Resources`: This directory contains the necessary databases used in the project.
- `README.md`: This file, which you are currently reading, provides an overview of the project.
