# Climate Analysis and Climate App

This repository contains a project that focuses on climate analysis and the development of a climate application using Flask. The goal is to perform a basic climate analysis and explore climate data for the city of Honolulu, Hawaii. 


## Project Overview


Welcome to the "Hawaii Climate Explorer" project! Let's analyze the climate before your trip to Honolulu, ensuring you're prepared for paradise.

### Part 1: Climate Analysis & Data Exploration

Using Python, SQLAlchemy, and visualizations, we'll explore the climate database. Highlights include:

- Precipitation: Plotting rainfall trends over the past 12 months.
- Super Station: Identifying the most active weather station and its temperature extremes.
- Temperature Time Machine: Visualizing the temperature observations at the most active station over the last 12 months.

### Part 2: Flask Climate App

We're building a fun climate app using Flask. It offers:

- Homepage: Start your journey here.
- Routes: Discover available routes in our app.
- Precipitation Analysis: Retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.
- Station List: Explore the list of weather stations.
- Temperature Observations: Access the previous year's temperature records.
- Custom Date Range: Get minimum, maximum, and average temperatures for specific date ranges.

Prepare for the Hawaii Climate Explorer app, where data meets adventure. Dive into the documentation and code files to unlock the secrets of Honolulu's weather patterns. Aloha! ðŸŒ´ðŸŒžðŸŒº
